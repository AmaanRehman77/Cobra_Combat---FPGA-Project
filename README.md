# Cobra_Combat---FPGA-Project

Recreated a mobile platformer game on the Altera DE10-Lite board using System Verilog. Designed User Friendly UI and textures to be outputted as a VGA monitor geared towards a scaled down FPGA part of the game. Game mechanics included collision detection and random number generation through hardware. 

This project project is a 2 player snake shooter game, where the objective is to hit the other player with venom shooting out of each snake’s head. The player must stay within the game arena, or they lose. Players must engage in combat while avoiding collision with obstacles or shooting them down. A player controls the snake’s movement by controlling the direction of the head as it moves around.
